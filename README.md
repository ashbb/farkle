Farkle on Shoes: Simple Dice Game with Shoes
============================================

I heard **Farkle** from [kotp](http://github.com/kotp/kotp.github.com/tree/master) a few days ago.
I've never heard and never played. But after a little bit googling.
I became quite interested in that. So, I attempted to write a tiny Ruby code as Shoes app. ;-)


Usage
-----

- download `farkle_shoes.rb` and `farkle_shoes_module.rb` under the same directory.
- execute `farkle_shoes.rb` with Shoes.


Play
----

Look at [online demo](http://www.rin-shun.com/rubylearning/shoes/farkle_on_shoes.swf.html).   

You can manage the game session (navigation) by yourself.   
Also call it `have to`, though. :-P

----------

Look at [this page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farkle) on Wikipedia.

Each 1   :  100
Each 5   :   50

Note

- The CLI version is [here](http://github.com/ashbb/farkle/tree/master/cli_version.md). A bit old (It's my first step and no maintenance), though. :-P
